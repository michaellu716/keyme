For this project you'll be creating a product list page and address entry form; pngs for both attached.

Please use any libraries or frameworks that will help you achieve the best
result in the most reasonable amount of time. It's important to us that you can explain why you chose certain technologies but much less important what those techs are.

Please use the attached pngs as reference/inspiration. You do not need to copy our styles exactly. Just produce a visually complete piece of work.

Please use the attached JSON to display product data.

Product List Page

 * We'd like see products paginated in groups of 9
 * "Add To Cart" buttons for each product should show the CTA when there are 0 selected products and +/- buttons when one or more items are selected.
 * This page should have a "Proceed to Checkout" that advances the user to the Address Entry Page

Address Entry Page

 * Please match the fields we have in place
 * The form should have basic validation
 * Successful form submission should show the user a modal to confirm their address.
